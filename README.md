## Workspace Layout

The web app will be stored in this repository.

## Version-Control Procedures

Team members should clone the app in Kollinâ€™s account of the project "**[dans-frappuccino-paradise](https://github.com/kollinmurphy/dans-frappuccino-paradise)**".  
Before each meeting, collaborators should submit a pull request so we can monitor progress and discuss issues.
After making any significant change, team members should notify the team for feedback.
During development we will work primarily on feature branches which will merge back into master.

## Tool Stack

This project uses Astro as a Server Side Renderer and SolidJS as a front-end framework. Additionally, we utilize a SQLite database and the Sequelize ORM.

- Pros:
  - Cutting\-edge technology
  - Super duper fast
  - The majority of the site is pure HTML \(with the addition of TailwindCSS and DaisyUI to make it easier\)
  - Easy to learn
  - Can use any UI framework \(Solid, Vue, React, Preact, Svelte, etc\.\)
    - Can also mix\-and\-match even within the project
  - Shows a lot of initiative on a resume
  - The API can be implemented using Astro, which is super intuitive
- Cons:
  - Little experience within the group
    - *Flip-side*: None of us have significant experience with Django or any other framework.
  - Limited documentation & examples
    - *Flip-side*: There is a lot of documentation for the UI framework(s) we decide to use, which is where most of our effort will be spent.

## Setup Procedure

1. Make sure you have `node` installed.
2. Clone the repo, `cd` into it, and run `npm run init`. This will initialize a SQLite database with the proper schema and seed it with some initial data, including the users `dan`, `employee`, and `user`, each with the password `password123`.

## Build Instructions

Just run `npm run build` and everything will work like a charm! It'll spin up a server on port 8080. View the front-end in the browser at `http://localhost:8080`.

## Unit Testing Instructions

The unit tests address several commonly identified uses including those found in the use case diagrams. The unit tests are located in @@@@. All unit test will be run by default, but it will be possible to run specific unit tests by inputting the number corresponding to the same use case. It is possible to test the following cases @@@@.

## System Testing Instructions

1.  Make sure you have `node` installed: [node](https://nodejs.org/en/).
