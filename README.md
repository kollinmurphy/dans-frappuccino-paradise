## Tool Stack

This project uses Astro as a Server Side Renderer and SolidJS as a front-end framework. Additionally, we
utilize a SQLite database and the Sequelize ORM.

## Setup Procedure

1. Make sure you have `node` installed.
2. Clone the repo, `cd` into it, and run `npm run init`. This will initialize a SQLite database with the proper schema and seed it with some initial data, including the users `dan`, `employee`, and `user`, each with the password `password123`.

## Build Instructions

Just run `npm run build` and everything will work like a charm! It'll spin up a server on port 8080. View the front-end in the browser at `http://localhost:8080`.

## Unit Testing Instructions

The unit tests address several commonly identified uses including those found in the use case diagrams. The unit tests are located in @@@@. All unit test will be run by default, but it will be possible to run specific unit tests by inputting the number corresponding to the same use case. It is possible to test the following cases @@@@.

## System Testing Instructions

1.  Make sure you have `node` installed: [node](https://nodejs.org/en/).

3. Run `npm run build`. This will start up a server on port 8080. View the front-end in the browser at `http://localhost:8080`. The current user types are @@@@, and the testing password for each one is:  `password123`.
