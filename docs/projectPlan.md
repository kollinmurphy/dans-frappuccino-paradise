# __Project Plan__

__Project Summary__

To create a web application that serves all the core functionality of a coffee shop\. This includes user\-side functions such as ordering and purchasing coffee, seeing the user wallet, and adding funds to the user wallet, employee\-side tasks such as tracking hours worked and marking completed orders, and manager\-side tasks such as paying employees and ordering new supplies\.

__Team Organization__

We plan to be an evenly organized team, with rotating scrum masters\. Since Kollin has the most familiarity with the tech stack, he will serve as the first scrum master\. Code reviews will be implemented so that someone in the group reviews any code that is merged\.

__Software Development Process__

The development will be broken up into five phases\. Each phase will be a little like a Sprint in an Agile method and a little like an iteration in a Spiral process\. Specifically, each phase will be like a Sprint, in that work to be done will be organized into small tasks, placed into a “backlog”, and prioritized\. Then, using on time\-box scheduling, the team will decide which tasks the phase \(Sprint\) will address\. The team will use a Scrum Board to keep track of tasks in the backlog, those that will be part of the current Sprint, those in progress, and those that are done\.

Each phase will also be a little like an iteration in a Spiral process, in that each phase will include some risk analysis and that any development activity \(requirements capture, analysis, design, implementation, etc\.\) can be done during any phase\. Early phases will focus on understanding \(requirements capture and analysis\) and subsequent phases will focus on design and implementation\. Each phase will include a retrospective\. 

| Phase | Iteration                                            |
| ----- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| 1.    | Phase 1 - Requirements Capture                       |
| 2.    | Phase 2 - Analysis, Architectural, UI, and DB Design |
| 3.    | Phase 3 - Implementation                             |
| 4.    | Phase 4 - More Implementation and Testing            |

We will use Unified Modeling Language \(UML\) to document user goals, structural concepts, component interactions, and behaviors\. 

__Communication Policy__

We plan to meet, either physically or virtually, at least once a week\. Our primary method of communication will be via discord, where we already have a group set up and have met\. When we meet, we will go over what we have completed over the last week and what we plan to accomplish over the next week\. This Once a week minimum doesn’t mean that we aren’t able to ask questions and request assistance throughout the week\.

__Risk analysis__

Since we are building what is in essence a proof of concept project that won’t really be deployed, the main risk is that we don’t complete the project to the required specification and our grades suffer as a result\. To mitigate this, we will set achievable and timely goals that will allow us to complete the project in time\.
